# EDA_Uber-Requests

About the dataset
this dataset contains 6 columns 6745 rows it holds some information about requests of Uber users like request id, pickup point, driver id , request status (completed, canceled, no car available), request and drop timestamp
I'm going to make an exploratory data analysis for this dataset to extract some useful insights to increase the use of Uber service.
